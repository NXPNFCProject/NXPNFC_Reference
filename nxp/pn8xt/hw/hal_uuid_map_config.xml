<!-- UUID: Universally Unique IDentifier -->
<!-- 16 Byte UUID need to be generated by vendors to add new entry -->
<!-- As per global platform access control spec, UUID is expected to be of -->

<!-- UID: user identifier of the service -->

<!-- This mapping file should contain an entry for VTS tests, since VTS -->

<!-- For VTS tests use UID: 0 and UUID: 9f36407ead0639fc966f14dde7970f68 -->
